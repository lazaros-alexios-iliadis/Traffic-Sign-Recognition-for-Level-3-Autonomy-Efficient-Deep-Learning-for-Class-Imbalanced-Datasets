# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-for-Level-3-Autonomy-Efficient-Deep-Learning-for-Class-Imbalanced-Datasets

Code for the paper "Traffic Sign Recognition for Level-3 Autonomy: Efficient Deep Learning for Class-Imbalanced Datasets", which was presented in MOCAST 2025 conference. The goal is to develop code based on green coding guidelines. The models are trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The multiclass_metrics.py file is taken from https://github.com/yandex-research/classification-measures/tree/main
